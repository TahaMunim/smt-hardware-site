You will rebuild and ADD THREE NEW PAGES to my existing React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind project.

The new pages you MUST create inside:
src/pages/About.tsx
src/pages/Services.tsx
src/pages/Contact.tsx

You MUST physically create these files in the project.
Do NOT output code only — actually generate the project files.

All pages must be responsive, modern, and follow a professional grey/white/black industrial theme.
