Rebuild my **Next.js + TailwindCSS** business website for **Saleh Mohsin Trading LLC (SMT)** with the following changes:

## Fix Button Design (Consistency)
- All buttons must follow **one consistent style** across all pages:
  - Background: yellow (#FFD600).
  - Text: black, bold, uppercase.
  - Shape: fully rounded (rounded-full).
  - Padding: px-6 py-3 (same everywhere).
  - Hover effect: black background with yellow text + smooth transition.
- Apply to: header CTAs, hero CTAs, product "Get Quote" buttons, contact forms, and footer links.

## Fix Product & Category Images
- All product and category images must **match actual hardware, sealants, adhesives, and safety gear** (no random stock art).
- Use **realistic industrial placeholders** until I upload my own photos.
- Placeholders should visually match categories:
  - **Power Tools:** drills, cordless tools, saws.
  - **Hand Tools:** wrenches, hammers, pliers.
  - **Construction Chemicals:** sealants, adhesives, WD40 cans, Tuffix tubes, Sika buckets.
  - **Safety Equipment:** helmets, gloves, safety goggles.
  - **Sanitary:** taps, faucets, pipes.
  - **Electrical:** wires, switches, sockets.
  - **Construction Materials:** cement bags, screws, consumables.
- In `/app/products/ProductGrid.tsx`, replace mismatched images with category-appropriate placeholders.
- Document clearly in comments where I can replace these placeholder image URLs with my **own shop/product images**.
