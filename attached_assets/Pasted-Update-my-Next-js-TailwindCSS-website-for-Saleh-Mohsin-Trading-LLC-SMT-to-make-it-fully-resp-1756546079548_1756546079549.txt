Update my **Next.js + TailwindCSS website for Saleh Mohsin Trading LLC (SMT)** to make it fully responsive, aesthetic, and fix visibility issues. Apply the following improvements:

## 1. Full Responsiveness
- Ensure the website adapts seamlessly to **mobile, tablet, laptop, and large desktops**.
- Use **flexbox and grid layouts with responsive breakpoints** (sm, md, lg, xl).
- Navigation:
  - On desktop: full nav bar with logo and links.
  - On mobile: collapsible hamburger menu with sliding drawer.
- Hero sections:
  - Background images must resize properly (use `object-cover` + `h-[min-80vh]` for mobile).
  - Headings and CTAs must center align on mobile, left align on desktop.
- Product Grid:
  - 2–3 columns on tablet, 1 column on mobile, 4+ columns on desktop.
- Footer:
  - Stack items vertically on mobile, horizontal layout on desktop.

## 2. Fix Image Display Issues
- Some images are not showing correctly — fix by:
  - Ensuring all product & hero images use `object-cover` and `aspect-square` or `aspect-video` depending on layout.
  - Use `max-w-full h-auto` to prevent overflow or cutoff.
  - Provide **fallback placeholder image** if the source image fails.
- Add inline comments in product components showing where I can replace placeholders with real shop/product images.

## 3. Fix Background & Visibility Issues
- Elements hidden because of dark background:
  - Ensure all **text has enough contrast** against backgrounds.
  - Use **white text (#FFFFFF)** on dark/black sections.
  - Use **black text (#000000)** on light/yellow sections.
  - Apply `bg-opacity-80` overlays where background images reduce text readability.
- Buttons:
  - Always yellow (#FFD600 background) with black text.
  - On hover: invert colors (black background, yellow text).
- Section overlays:
  - Hero sections should use a subtle dark overlay on background images (`bg-black/50`) to make text visible.

## 4. Aesthetic Improvements
- Apply **consistent padding/margin** across all sections (`px-6 py-12` default).
- Add **rounded-xl** corners and soft shadows to product cards.
- Ensure typography hierarchy:
  - Hero heading: text-4xl on mobile, text-6xl on desktop.
  - Section headings: text-2xl to text-4xl depending on device size.
  - Body text: text-base with relaxed leading.
- Add smooth **fade-in animations** for sections when scrolling into view.

## 5. Technical Notes
- Framework: Next.js (App Router) + TailwindCSS.
- Ensure images and text never overlap on smaller devices.
- Test across breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl.
- Provide clear inline comments in Hero, ProductGrid, and About components for where I can replace:
  - Background images
  - Product/shop photos
  - Team photos

## Final Goal
The website must:
- Look **professional and aesthetic** on **any device** (mobile-first design).
- Never have **hidden elements** due to background color conflicts.
- Ensure **all images display properly** with correct aspect ratios.
- Maintain **consistent, modern styling** across all pages.
